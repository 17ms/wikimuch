CSS and JavaScript interface changes to clean up Wikipedia. Remade for the recent Wikipedia facelift.

The old WikiMuch v2 still supports the [main instance](https://wikiless.org) of [Wikiless](https://codeberg.org/orenom/wikiless), a privacy-friendly Wikipedia front-end without JavaScript. Therefore, it has been renamed to `wikiless.user.js`.

[Lyutria](https://userstyles.org/users/266181) created a nice little mish-mash of the Wikipedia Minimal and the Paper (Sidebar) styles, as you can [find here](https://userstyles.org/styles/102164). I tweaked a lot of stuff and added language selection via [Paul's](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/10155-paul-the-anonymous) [Wikipedia rearrange other languages](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10731).

The new v3 has been made from scratch.
